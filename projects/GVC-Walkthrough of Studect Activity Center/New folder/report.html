<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Here is an explaination of our project on Student’s Activity Center OUTSIDE + Gym Inside and the procedure we followed to complete our project..</p>
<p>
We have used tutorials on www.learningwebgl.com  to learn various functions of webGL. We also learned using MAYA and COPPER CUBE platform to make the dynamic model of building and walkthrough. We have made our model in Google Sketchup and used COPPER CUBE for texture mapping and fitting camera and giving lightning effects.</p> 
<h4>WebGL</h4>
<p>
WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics within any compatible web browser. WebGL programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code that is executed on a computer’s graphics.</p>
<p>
There are various inbuilt functions in webGL to give a 3D effect to model, to develop an animation, to set a series of transformation,lightning effects can be easily implemented using webGL. There are some of the functions to initialize webGL, <br/>
<b>initGL(canvas):-</b> canvas element on which we want to draw our 3D stuff.<br/>
<b>initBuffers():-</b>buffers are things that hold the details of the stuff we are drawing.<br/>
<b>gl.clearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0):-</b> clear the canvas.<br/></p>
<p>webGL code runs on web browser. Coding is done in any of the text editor and saved as .html file. A javascript file consists of webGL function definitions and codes which programmatically control out html page layout.</p>

<h4>Maya - 3D Animation Software - Autodesk</h4>
<p>Maya  -3D –Autodesk is an animation software which provide excellent platform to develop 3D animations, games, models and many more. Users define a virtual workspace (scene) to implement and edit media of a particular project. Scenes can be saved in a variety of formats, the default being .mb (Maya Binary). Maya exposes a node graph architecture. Scene elements are node-based, each node having its own attributes and customization. As a result, the visual representation of a scene is based entirely on a network of interconnecting nodes, depending on each others information.  We can use cubes, cylinders, and spheres to develop our main building's walls,pillars and other components. We are creating walls and floors using planes and cubes.</p>

<h4>Copper cube</h4>

<p>CopperCube supports real-time 3D character animation, also known as skeletal animation. This is done using an animated skeleton consisting of joints with a skin of vertices. We can model and animate animated characters using any 3d software, exporting and importing them into Coppercube:
The model make in Maya is imported to CopperCube. Texture mapping, placing a camera to walkthrough. Finally we publish it to web browser in .html format.</p>
 
<h4>Google SketchUp</h4>
<p>SketchUp is a 3D modeling program marketed by Google and designed for architectural, civil, and mechanical engineers as well as filmmakers, game developers, and related professions. The program, which is designed for ease of use,[2] allows placement of models within Google Earth.</p>
<p>Google Sketchup is a platform where we have generated our SAC building. All structure walls, road, fencing, street lights, garden and texture mapping is done in google sketup. This software proved to be fortunate for our project.</p>

<h4>Hypercosm_Teleporter_for_SketchUp_Lite_1.8.0.2</h4>
<p>This is a plugin require to convert a googleSketchup 3-D view into a model which is supported by brwoser. It gives us all files including java-script file and textures which are included in our 3-D model. Now we get a .html file with its .js file. From now we can publish this on web Browser in any other machine which does not have softwares installed.</p>

<h4>Distribution of Task</h4>
<p>
Our distribution of work was well planned. We did all jobs consecutively i.e. time by time we kept on shifting parts of our project to our members. Thus we synchronised among ourselves and successfully completed the project.<br/>
For initial days<b>Shubham Singhal</b> and <b>Kunal Bansal</b> foccused on Front part of SAC <br/>
<b>Anoop Arora</b> and <b>Kumar Harsh</b> foccused on GYM outside and inside both.<br/>
<b>Nikhil Karnwal</b> foccused on taking measurements and starting of our project. He make the back of SAC, which we continued henceforth. Unfortunately he went on medical leave and we had to continue without him.</p>

<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>We started working on the project from the day it was given to us . Initially we started on the MAYA Platform , but due to certain 
circumstaces we shifted to Google SketchUp and we have completed our project while using the latter platform . 
On 13 april, 2012 we had made progress in our project , we were regularly showing our project to the TA's in lab . 
on 20 april,2012 we had completed our SAC FRONT , but still there was lot to cover i.e. GYM and the outside garden .
Till 22 april,2012 we were glad to say that we had completed our project on the Google Sketchup , and the only thing which remained was the code generation 
and transfer of project on copper cube . After working for quite a long time we have finally completed our project .
</p>    

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>We really had a good experience while working on the project . we all really enjoy sharing thoughts and knowledge with each other . This was our 
first attempt in the vast field of Graphics and we tried to learn a lot from it . With the guidance from our respected Teacher and the TA we have 
successfully completed our project .
